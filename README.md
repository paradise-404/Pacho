Aesthetic image retriever. Use for art inspo, beautiful phone backgrounds, your own creative projects, or just for browsing. 

Pacho returns results from Tumblr, Twitter, Pixiv, and Pinterest. 

These are social media platforms that rank aesthetic images yet are not easily found in Google Image Search. 

Also returns the keywords in Japanese for images inaccessible by English.
 
Usage:
 * Download the JAR and run it. Pacho should open up as a black search bar on your desktop.
 * Make sure you're logged in to the social media platforms above before using.
 * Type in your search terms like "viridian" or "bubble tea" and hit the play button.
 * Tumblr, Twitter, and Pinterest will open up to their results for your search term.
 * Plus, your term, translated in Japanese, is now copied onto your clipboard.
 * Pixiv doesn't search automatically due to Japanese encoding issues, so you can copy paste your new search term into Pixiv.
 * If the Japanese dictionary reported multiple results, your results will show as R1 * R2, with an asterisk separating your two results.

Parameters:
Mac only right now.
