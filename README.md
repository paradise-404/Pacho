Aesthetic image retriever on your desktop. Use for art inspo, beautiful phone backgrounds, your own creative projects, or just for browsing.

Pacho returns results from Tumblr, Twitter, Pixiv, and Pinterest.

These are social media platforms that rank aesthetic images yet are not easily found in Google Image Search.

[Pacho Premium](https://www.patreon.com/paradiselost404): Also returns the keywords in Japanese for images inaccessible by English. ♥

Usage:

• Download the JAR and run it. Pacho will open up as a black search bar on your desktop.

• Make sure you're logged in to the social media platforms above before using.

• Type in your search terms like "bubble tea" and hit the play button.

• Tumblr, Twitter, Pixiv, and Pinterest will open up to their results for your search term.


Premium:

• Your search term will be automatically translated into Japanese. The sites, now with Japanese search, will open.

• Pixiv will open in two tabs. Sometimes Japanese returns multiple results, so the 2nd tab will show any other Japanese translations (eg. 1. オレンジ & 2. えんしょく)


Parameters: Mac, Windows
